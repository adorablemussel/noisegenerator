# Noise Generator

**Noise Generator** is a tool that creates grayscale noise textures based on the digits of mathematical constants, such as **œÄ (Pi)**.

## üß† How It Works

The core idea is to extract digits after the decimal point of a number and use each digit to determine the brightness of a pixel in a grayscale image.

Each digit from 0 to 9 maps linearly to a brightness level:

<div align="center">
  
| Digit | Brightness | 8-bit RGB Value | Normalized RGB Value |
|-------|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 0     | 0%         | (0, 0, 0)        | (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       |
| 1     | ~11%       | (28, 28, 28)     | (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)       |
| 2     | ~22%       | (57, 57, 57)     | (0.2, 0.2, 0.2)       |
| ...   | ...        | ...              | ...                   |
| 9     | 100%       | (255, 255, 255)  | (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)       |
  
</div>

After processing the digits, the result is saved as a `.bmp` image like the ones below:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites

Before building and running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **CMake**  
   Tool for generating build systems for C++.  
   Download: [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. **C++ Compiler**  
   For example:
   - **Visual Studio 2019/2022** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload
   - Or another compiler that supports C++17 (e.g., g++, clang)

3. **vcpkg** ‚Äì C++ package manager  
   This project uses libraries installed via vcpkg.  
   Installation guide: [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

### Building the Project

1. Open a terminal (`cmd`, PowerShell, or terminal in Visual Studio Code).
2. Navigate to the `build` directory in the project root:
   ```bash
   cd build
3. Run CMake with the vcpkg toolchain file:

   Find the path to your vcpkg.cmake file...

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[...AND PASTE IT HERE]

   # mine is:
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Libraries/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .

 ### Running the Program

   After a successful build, run the executable (typically located in the Debug folder):
   ```bash
   .\Debug\NoiseGenerator.exe
